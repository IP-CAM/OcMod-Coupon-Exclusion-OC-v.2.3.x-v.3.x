# Coupon Exclusion

An OpenCart extension that inverts coupon allowed product and category lists into exclusion lists. This simplifies coupon management by letting you apply coupons store-wide while excluding only specific products or categories. It’s especially useful when most items are eligible, and only a few need to be excluded — saving time and reducing configuration errors.

Compatible with OpenCart 2.3.x/3.x.
